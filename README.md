# Capacity-Estimation-on-the-Mathworks-5G-NR-CDL-Model
Single-link channel capacity estimation on the microwave and millimetre wave frequencies by using the Mathworks 5G NR CDL model for NLOS.
This is an example of estimating the average channel capacity where the wireless channel is modelled by the Mathworks 5G CDL model that is provided in the 5G Toolbox. The single-link NLOS channel is assumed. 
To calculate the channel capacity, for microwave frequency signals, the MIMO multiplexing is used; for millimetre wave frequency signals, the hybrid precoding algorithm is adopted at both ends of the link. 
A .pdf document on implementing the code is uploaded, where the detailed information on the simulation is demonstrated. The only .m script the launcher code.
